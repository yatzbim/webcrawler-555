This expired on May 4, 2020 as upheld by the Department of Justice.[48] The Philippine press[edit] Deeply steeped in the tradition of media as a watchdog,[49] and as a “fourth estate” helping to maintain the checks and balances of democratic governance,[50][51] the Philippine press has long been celebrated at as being the freest and noisiest in Asia,[1] even though it is considered one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist.[52] Media watchdogs such as Reporters Without Borders, the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, the Photojournalists' Center of the Philippines (PCP), Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (FOCAP), and the Consortium on Democracy and Disinformation (D&D)[53] have noted that various forms of attacks against the press have increased since the Duterte administration came to power in 2016 – with the Philippine Daily Inquirer, news website Rappler, nonprofit media organizations like Vera Files and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, and ABS-CBN being particular targets because of coverage critical of the administration.[53][52][54] Many of these media watchdogs[53] have issued statements placing the ABS-CBN broadcast stoppage in the context of systemic attacks against press freedom in the Philippines.[53][54] The ABS-CBN broadcast network[edit] The ABS-CBN broadcast network is acknowledged to be one of the Philippines' oldest and most influential media networks, run by the Lopez family.[3] The company generates about 50 to 60 percent of the group's total annual revenue mainly from selling airtime of its television and radio properties to advertisers. The remaining revenue is generated from consumer sales through distribution of cable and international channels, as well as operations of over-the-top platform services, and a family entertainment center in Taguig. According to the Philippine Competition Commission, ABS-CBN Corporation controlled "somewhere between 31% and 44%" of the Philippines' total television market as of 2020.[55] Prior broadcast stoppage under Ferdinand Marcos[edit] Main article: Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos Prior to the 2020 stoppage, ABS-CBN was closed down from September 23, 1972 until September 14, 1986 during martial law under Ferdinand Marcos (lifted in 1981) and from 1981, the Fourth Philippine Republic. Its television and radio stations were sequestered by the government and awarded to his crony Roberto Benedicto through the Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), forming a de facto media monopoly with Kanlaon Broadcasting System/Radio Philippines Network (KBS/RPN), Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC), and government-owned Government Television/Maharlika Broadcasting System (GTV/MBS). The company's headquarters, the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center was also sequestered to serve as headquarters of the aforementioned networks except IBC, along with the Bureau of Broadcasts. The sequestered stations were recovered in the aftermath of People Power Revolution in July 1986, when the Aquino government dissolved BBC and returned the frequencies to ABS-CBN. History[edit] Early renewal initiatives during the 16th Congress[edit] See also: 16th Congress of the Philippines In 2014 and 2015, ABS-CBN requested the 16th Congress to tackle the extension of its franchise early, despite the fact that its renewal was not due until six years later, in 2020.[2] Media sources in the legislature indicated that the network's 2016 initiative was the result of having been "particularly singled out" by supporters of President-elect Rodrigo Duterte because of the perception that they "consistently showed him in a negative light".[2] The Philippine Daily Inquirer reported that a member of the House legislative franchise committee said ABS-CBN "did not want to risk going through the renewal under an 'unfriendly' administration."[56] The Inquirer's source also said that the initiative "lacked support from President Benigno Aquino III's allies in the House" because they felt that ABS CBN's criticisms against Aquino were "too personal and offensive and went to the point of nitpicking."[56][2] ABS-CBN eventually had to withdraw these franchise renewal initiatives due to time constraints.[2] Ad controversies during the 2016 Philippine presidential campaign[edit] Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has attributed his objection to the franchise renewal of ABS-CBN to an election ad controversy during the campaign leading up to the 2016 Philippine presidential election. He said that the network's refusal to air his 2016 presidential campaign ads in favor of an advertisement paid by then-vice presidential candidate Antonio Trillanes critical of his remarks on the campaign trail.[57][58] The network's president and CEO Carlo Katigbak has apologized to President Duterte for not airing his political advertisements during his 2016 polls. President Duterte has accepted the apology, leaving the franchise's renewal to the Congress.[59][60] ABS-CBN also offered to return the money spent for these advertisements, which Duterte declined, stating that the money should be donated to a charity instead.[59] Meanwhile, Commission on Elections spokesperson James Jimenez defended the controversial ad as being well within Election Law, under "Partisan Political Activity"[61][62] Renewal initiatives during the 17th and 18th Congress[edit] Non-renewal assertions by Duterte[edit] Throughout his term, which coincides with the 17th and 18th Congress, President Duterte publicly reiterated that he will oppose the 25-year franchise renewal of ABS-CBN.[8] Opposition lawmakers as well as labor groups objected to Duterte's stand on ABS-CBN as the franchise non-renewal will compromise the employees of the network; stating that the blocking of the franchise renewal had no merit.[63] Opposition groups have stated their opinions that the non-renewal of the franchise violates press freedom.[53] The President later changed his stance after the network's apology, stating that he will not interfere with the franchise renewal in the Congress. However, the President did not say whether he will veto the bill or not[59][60] 17th Congress[edit] In November 2016, Nueva Ecija Representative Micaela Violago filed House Bill 4349 in the 17th Congress to renew the network's franchise.[64][65] The 17th Congress adjourned sine die with the bill never getting out of committee.[66] Deliberations during the 18th Congress[edit] In the 18th Congress of the Philippines, at least 12 lawmakers has filed their own versions for a new franchise of the network. House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano has made assurances that the Congress will tackle the franchise with fairness.[67] On February 24, 2020, the Congress finally made its decision to tackle their franchise renewal.[68] During a Senate hearing on the same day, public services panel chair Grace Poe stated they were to tackle ABS-CBN's compliance with the terms and conditions of its franchise.[69] The conclusion was that there was no breach of laws or franchise terms. The following is a summary of the findings: The Bureau of Internal Revenue stated that ABS-CBN had fully complied with the tax requirements of the government. Sir Cabantac Jr., BIR Large Taxpayers Service head stated that the company had paid P14.298 billion from 2016 to 2019. In 2019, ABS-CBN also settled P152.44 million in tax payments with the BIR.[70] The Department of Labor and Employment cleared the media giant for its compliance with general labor standards, occupational safety and health, and security of tenure. Former ABS-CBN corporate services head Mark Nepomuceno said they also have contributed to mandatory employee benefits such as SSS, Phil-Health, PAG-IBIG. He also stated that ABS-CBN was no longer practicing end-of-contract scheme, as well as giving benefits to independent contributors varying per contract negotiation[70] Telecommunications Commissioner General Gamaliel Cordoba stated that franchise laws cover "commercial purposes", including pay-per-view service. Section 1 of Republic Act 7908, which allows ABS-CBN Covergence's broadcast operations, states that: "It is hereby granted a franchise to construct, operate, and maintain, for commercial purposes." Even though ABS-CBN introduced the service without NTC guidelines yet, the fine for such violation is a measly P200. Senate President Recto stated that the NTC can just impose a fine on ABS-CBN rather than shutdown.[70] Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner Ephyro Amatong clarified that a legal interpretation from 1999 stated that Philippine Depository Receipts were not equivalent to certificates of ownership, which may have evolved in recent years. Senator Poe pointed out that companies should be notified of any changes in the legal interpretation of the investment instrument, as all media companies have to be 100% Filipino-owned. Issuing PDRs is a common practice among Philippine media outfits—including Rappler and GMA. The SEC has not yet conducted a review whether there are violations in ABS-CBN's PDRs, with Amatong saying he "would rather not make a categorical statement at this time" as to whether there are violations in ABS-CBN's PDRs, given the pending case at the Supreme Court, as of May 6, 2020.[70] Quo warranto petition[edit] On February 10, 2020, Solicitor General of the Philippines Jose Calida filed a quo warranto petition before the Supreme Court of the Philippines seeking to disfranchise ABS-CBN and its subsidiary ABS-CBN Convergence over alleged breaches of its franchise, including operating its pay-per-view service Kapamilya Box Office and constitutional restriction on foreign ownership of mass media.[71] The network responded to disprove the allegations levelled against it.[72] Within the same month, various congressmen urged the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to grant a provisional authority to ABS-CBN to continue operations after the lapse of its current franchise until Congress has made a decision on its franchise application.[73] Having consulted with the Department of Justice (DOJ), the NTC affirmed in March 2020 that it would "likely" issue a provisional authority to ABS-CBN and "let ABS-CBN continue operations based on equity".[74] However, the Federation of International Cable TV and Telecommunications Associations of the Philippines questioned the provisional authority, stating that it would be unconstitutional.[75] May 2020 broadcast stoppage[edit] On May 3, 2020, Calida warned NTC against granting the provisional authority to ABS-CBN, citing a Supreme Court decision in 2014, stating that provisional authority can only be granted after the franchise is secured in the Congress.[73][71] In the same statement, Calida cautioned that the agency would put itself at risk of prosecution under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act should they issue the provisional authority without a legal franchise being held by ABS-CBN's operating companies, and that a 1991 DOJ's opinion stating the NTC may issue provisional authority without a legal franchise was turned over by the Supreme Court.[71] On May 5, 2020, NTC issued a cease and desist order to temporarily close its broadcasting operations, including its radio stations DZMM, its television counterpart, DZMM TeleRadyo and MOR, following the expiration of its broadcast franchise the day before.[76][77][78][1][79][4] The cease and desist order covers 42 television stations operated by ABS-CBN across the country, including the main ABS-CBN Network, ABS-CBN Sports and Action, 10 digital broadcast channels, 18 FM stations, and 5 AM stations. However, ABS-CBN News Channel and its sister cable channels (run by subsidiary Creative Programs), as well as its online properties, Star Music and Star Cinema, were allowed to continue.[80] The network signed-off the air at 7:52 pm (UTC +8) following the news program TV Patrol and with the playing of the national anthem "Lupang Hinirang;" the newscast also simulcasted on S+A and MOR stations before the sign-off.[81] ABS-CBN executives Carlo Katigbak and Mark Lopez aired statements appealing the NTC cease and desist order.[82][83] ABS-CBN was also given 10 days to explain why its assigned frequencies should not be recalled.[84] Reactions and impact[edit] Prior to broadcast stoppage[edit] Before the expiration of the broadcast franchise, ABS-CBN talents and employees conducted weekly demonstrations in front of its headquarters in Quezon City as well as in its regional stations from January to February 2020.[85][86] During these demonstrations, presidential daughter and incumbent Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio expressed support for the franchise renewal.[87] After the broadcast stoppage[edit] The NTC's cease and desist order on ABS-CBN was met by widespread criticism by the Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines (in which the network is one of its members),[88] as well as various advocacy groups,[89][90] business organizations,[91][92] the local Catholic church, [93][94][95] and even some members of the Congress. Several journalists and celebrities from the network and its rival GMA Network expressed solidarity with ABS-CBN after it was ordered to cease its radio and TV broadcast.[96][97] The hashtag #NoToABSCBNShutDown topped the local and worldwide Twitter trending lists the same day.[98] Within a day, numerous colleges and universities in the Philippines, including the UPLB College of Development Communication, Ateneo de Manila University and its Communication Department, the University of Santo Tomas, St. Scholastica's College and its Mass Communication Department, De La Salle University, and the UP Diliman College of Mass Communication released statements supporting the franchise renewal of ABS-CBN.[99] The network's shutdown is noted to have placed the job security of 11,000 ABS-CBN employees in jeopardy during the COVID-19 pandemic, though the company assured them stable salary, and complete health and financial benefits for the next 2 months following the shutdown.[1][4] In response, the government may give a 2-month aid to the employees of ABS-CBN.[100] GMA Network's shares increased by 24% as the Philippine Stock Exchange voluntarily suspends ABS-CBN's trading. However, investors remained cautious on GMA's stock rally due to the effects of the shutdown on business confidence.[101][102] President Duterte has denied involvement with the network's shutdown.[103] He also thanked the network for its assistance to the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.[59][104] According to his spokesman, Harry Roque, the president cannot mark the bill renewing ABS-CBN's franchise as urgent because it involves private interest, and that the president will be neutral to the renewal.[105] The criticism behind ABS-CBN's shutdown mainly revolves around the NTC, for lack of fairness on the agency's cease and desist order on the network, and Congress - especially the lower house - for inaction to pass the franchise renewal bill.[106][107] Aftermath[edit] On May 7, 2020, two days after the main network ceased broadcasting, ABS-CBN Corporation filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition, as well as temporary restraining order before the Supreme Court of the Philippines, seeking to nullify the NTC's cease and desist order. [108] On the other hand, the Senate and the House of the Representatives filed respective bills urging NTC to reconsider its order, as well as to abolish the agency itself. [109] [110] On the same day, ABS-CBN's flagship news program TV Patrol resumed broadcast on the ABS-CBN News Channel, as it simulcast the program from the main network since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic programming changes. [111] It was also simulcast on its news website, its Facebook and YouTube pages, as well as on The Filipino Channel to viewers outside the country.[citation needed] The 1st day of broadcast mainly covered the effects of the network's shutdown as well as the COVID-19 pandemic updates.[citation needed] On May 5, 2020, DZMM TeleRadyo rebranded as simply TeleRadyo after its AM counterpart was forced to cease and desist by NTC's order.[citation needed] It resumed regular programming on May 8, airing the usual DZMM programming.[citation needed] TeleRadyo is carried through ABS-CBN TV Plus, making it one of three exclusive channels (the other being Cine Mo! and Yey!) that remain operational on digital free-to-air television after the NTC's order takes effect.[citation needed] That same day, MOR Philippines also resumed its online and cable operations through a national programming service set up by the network's flagship station in Metro Manila.[citation needed] See also[edit] Media of the Philippines Television in the Philippines 2007 Venezuelan RCTV protests – triggered by similar government action to shut down a private television network References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i Cabato, Regine (May 5, 2020).
